# About Me

My name is Hoai, a fresh graduate from VNUHCM â€“ University of Science. I am able to evolve in both research and engineering tasks with well-trained problem solving skill and understanding of machine learning principles which I have been learning from my university.

I want to become a Data Scientist who can turn raw data into meaningful insights and bring enterprise-ready data science solutions to businesses.

Apart from being a Data Scientist, I enjoy most of my time with running, papercraft, and reading books. I usually make papercraft while listening to music in my free time. I am trying hard to become a lifetime runner like Haruki Murakami. In the future, I want to finish a marathon and an IRONMAN triathlon.
